                                <p>
                                  Many entrepreneurs are very talented, create exceptional products,
                                  and yet fail due to running out of available capital or failing to build a community of stakeholders around
                                  the proliferation of their product, resulting in too limited market adoption.
                                </p>

                                <br>

                                  presence as a quality revenue producing company through our maintained investor relations, resulting in
                                  increased likelihood of follow-on or pre-seed investment upon client milestone achievements.
